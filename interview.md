Interview
=========

During the interview, you should:

## Do

- Ask for help or hints about a question if needed;
- Be humble and open-minded;
- Stay focused;
- Think (but not too much) about the problem before starting to write a solution;
- Treat every question as legitimate;
- Write code on the white board (also bringing your own dry-erase markers).

## Avoid

- Change the subject to avoid a question;
- Look arrogant;
- Question the validity of a question;
- Tell the interviewer how to interview.
